# boggle-cpp

A simple word finder for boggle.

usage: `boggle.exe [board-filename=board.txt] [dictionary-filename=words.txt]`

Spits out possible words in alphabetical order.

Oh also, I grabbed that words text file from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), it contains a lot of weird fake words, but I figure you can filter through the results to get what you want anyway.

I'll update this to support any board size... at some point.
